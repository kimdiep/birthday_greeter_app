## I documented my approach in 'kd_approach.md' <---- Please read me! :)
- I documented and explained the processes and approaches I used

**To improve my project, next time I would like to:**

## Introduction to the project

This project is part of Week 3 of the Makers Academy 12-week software engineering programme.

The aim of this project is to build a web app that will ask the user for a name and birthday. When the user submits the form, and depending on the current date, the app will either:

- wish the user happy birthday
- tell them how long they'll have to wait until their next birthday

https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/intro_to_the_web/post_challenges/birthday_app.md


## Motivation: What are my goals for this project?

#### For this challenge, I am specifically targeting the following Makers Academy goals:

I have a methodical approach to solving problems
I can debug anything
I can TDD anything

In order to test my understanding of web apps and verify that I can build a simple web app with a form using an MVC framework, I will build a birthday greeter app.

#### Relating to the above high-level goals, I would like to:

- Document and explain the processes and approaches I used

> This is presented in: 'kd_approach.md'.

Concrete things
- Apply the MVC framework `Sinatra` to build a simple web app

Concepts
- Understand MVC frameworks

Processes
- Use test-driven development to test-drive the app. I would like to apply the use of Capybara for feature testing the user flow.

Behaviours/mindset
- Take a step back to understand how to model the birthday greeter app

## Tech/Framework Used

I will be using Capybara testing as it has extensions for RSpec. I will be particularly focusing on feature-testing the user flow for this project.

You can find out more about Capybara here: http://teamcapybara.github.io/capybara/

RSpec will be used as the testing framework.  

>"RSpec is a Behaviour-Driven Development tool for Ruby programmers. BDD is an approach
to software development that combines Test-Driven Development, Domain Driven Design,
and Acceptance Test-Driven Planning. RSpec helps you do the TDD part of that equation,
focusing on the documentation and design aspects of TDD." 

See documentation:
https://relishapp.com/rspec
http://rspec.info/


The MVC framework, `Sinatra` will be used to build a simple web app. Ruby will be used as the programming language and HTML in Sinatra views for the user interface.

## Code Style


## How to use the program

### 1. Getting Started


## Images/Screenshots

## Getting started

`git clone `

## Running tests

Tests can be run from the root directory using:

`rspec`
